# QR Code Generator (Python)

This is a simple Python-based QR code generator built as part of the **Advanced Artificial Intelligence (MSCS-633-A01)** course at the **University of the Cumberlands**.

## 📌 Description

This program takes a URL as input and generates a corresponding QR code image. The user can also specify the filename for the output image, or let the program generate one using a timestamp. It includes input validation and exception handling to improve robustness and usability.

## 🛠 Features

- ✅ Takes user input for URL and filename
- ✅ Generates dynamic filenames with timestamps
- ✅ Uses `qrcode` Python library
- ✅ Includes error handling
- ✅ Fully commented (program, function, and line levels)
